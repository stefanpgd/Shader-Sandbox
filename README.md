# Shader Sandbox
A small environment to try out different compute and pixel shaders

### Why?
I created this project to have a simple environment to research a few different things. I wanted to learn about compute shaders, tricks in pixel shaders and raymarching. Since most of these topics overlap the same premise I decided to combine them into this one project.
